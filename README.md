# Stadium-App

Clubs in five major European leagues (EPL, La Liga, Ligue 1, Serie A and Bundesliga) and MLS have their stadium locations on a Leaflet map, displayed with the club's logo. The tooltip over the icon shows the names of the club and stadium, and clicking on the icon displays further information as well as statistics of home games.
